* This is a new release.

* There is a note about a suggested package not in mainstream repositories. This package is available on the r-universe repository, and is only used for an optional function that checks if the package is installed, and asks whether to install it, if desired. This package is not available on CRAN yet but is necessary for that particular optional feature.

* There is a note about (possibly) invalid URLs (https://doi.org/10.1177/17470218211024826 and https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jac.12220) with Status: 503. However, these links were confirmed valid and both their doi version and journal version exhibit the same behaviour.

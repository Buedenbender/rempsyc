# Development objectives (to-do list)

-   Create new function to visualize outliers: violin scatter plots and add lines for +/- 3 MAD (or SD, based on selected method)
-   Reduce dependencies to make the package more lightweight
-   all `lm` functions
    -   Correct bug with sr2 and factors in lm models
    -   Add 95% confidence interval for sr2
-   `nice_t_test`
    -   Add other optional corrections argument (other than Bonferroni)
    -   Add option to specify `robust.d` for a robust version of Cohen's d
    -   Add option `bootstrapped.CI` to use a bootstrapped version of the 95% CI
-   `nice_table`
    -   Integration: add meaningful error messages when using `lm` or `t.test` with wrong model type.
-   `nice_lm_slopes`
    -   Support second moderator
-   `nice_slopes`
    -   Add support for multiple moderators (like for `nice_mod`)
-   `rcompanion_groupwiseMean`
    -   Rewrite with only the `boot` package and `dplyr::group_by`?
-   `nice_varplot`
    -   Add option to standardize or not
    -   Also add option to annotate Levene test on the plot
    -   Use violin points, and mean centered
-   `nice_contrasts`
    -   Need to accommodate: interactions/moderations in the models
    -   Also add option to specify contrasts manually
    -   Add option to not use robust Cohen's *d*
    -   Add option to not use bootstrapping
-   All functions
    -   Check for consistency among argument names like response/variable
        -   Check other packages to see what's most typically used
    -   Triple check support for missing values
-   Finish writing all function tests
-   Suggest collaboration with easystats
